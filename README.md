My first repository on GitHub

# introduction of myself
Hello world!
This is David from Singapore.
It is great to know there's GitHub on world.

Well, I've left Sigapore since April 2018. After one year working at Shanghai, I started working in Wuhan CHN since end of April 2019.
It's good to live and work in the city where my family stays.
